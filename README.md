# VK_Cup_Clever
The VK Cup competition was from 06.12.2019 to 16.12.2019. The data was a list of 41,087 questions, some of which were suggested by users, and some (about 10%) were created by editors. The challenge was to distinguish questions prepared by professional authors from questions suggested by game users.

"Clever" is an entertaining game with prizes that took place from March 14 to December 31, 2018 in a special mobile application. In the game, the participants had to choose the correct answer to the question asked from the three proposed options. Players who answered correctly all 12-15 questions of the game session equally divided the money fund being played.

The data for this problem was taken from the ML Boot Camp platform, from the materials of the VK Cup competition.

Feature engineering: search for patterns in text using regular expressions. There were added some features as the number of characters in the question, years, names of people, names of countries, Arabic and Roman numbers.
Logistic regression turned out to be better than the naive Bayesian classifier.
